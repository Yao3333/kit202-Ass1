    This page provides an explanation of implemented functionality.<br/>
• The page should include responses to the following points:<br/>
o Describe the theme your group chose for the blog.<br/>
o Explain your group's password policy for new user registration.<br/>
o Outline how your group decided to handle registration (changing the login form or directing the user to a new page)<br/>
o Describe any additional functionality/embellishments your group incorporated beyond the core specifications.<br/>
o List references for all assets (e.g., images, fonts, etc.) used as part of your design.<br/>
• The page should also include the names and student IDs of each group member and an indication of the percentage of<br/>
work completed by each member. This is assumed to be a third each (reasons should be given if this is not the case).<br/>
